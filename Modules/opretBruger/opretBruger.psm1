    NET USER creates and modifies user accounts on computers. When used
    without switches, it lists the user accounts for the computer. The
    user account information is stored in the user accounts database.

                 view. The name of the user account can have as many as
                 20 characters.

                 A password must satisfy the minimum length set with the
                 /MINPWLEN option of the NET ACCOUNTS command. It can have as
                 many as 14 characters.

                 displayed when you type it at a password prompt.

                                  day[-day][,day[-day]],time[-time][,time

                                  12-hour notation, use am, pm, a.m., or
                                  p.m. ALL means a user can always log on,
                                  and a blank value means a user can never
